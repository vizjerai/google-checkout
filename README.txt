== What is Google Checkout?

Well, according to Google, "Google Checkout helps you increase sales.  And
process them for free when you advertise with Google."  What it really amounts
to is that Google will process your orders for a 10% fee and you get a little
shopping cart icon in your ad if you advertise through AdWords.  The fee can
be paid by running AdWords ads on your site.  You can read about it and get an
account at http://checkout.google.com/sell.

== What is google-checkout?

google-checkout is a module for working with the Google Checkout API
(http://code.google.com/apis/checkout/index.html).  Specifically, if you have
a Google Checkout account, you can use this module to do things like add
"Checkout" and "Buy Now" buttons to your site.

== Brief Example

  require 'rubygems'
  require 'google-checkout'

  merchant_id = 'Your merchant id.'
  merchant_key = 'Your merchant key.  Keep this a secret!'

  cart = GoogleCheckout::Cart.new(merchant_id, merchant_key)
  cart.add_item(:name => 'Chair', :description => 'A sturdy, wooden chair',
                :price => 44.99)
  puts cart.checkout_button

== Usage

First, you'll need a merchant ID and a merchant key, which you can get from
the Google Checkout site once you have an account.  After you have that, you
can start writing code.  

The class you'll be working with is GoogleCheckout::Cart.  Of course, it
represents a cart, and you can fill it with items.  

  cart = GoogleCheckout::Cart.new(merchant_id, merchant_key, item1, item2)
  cart.add_item item3

The items you put into the cart should be one of two types:
* A Hash containing the following
** :name
** :description
** :price
** :quantity (default 1)
** :currency (default 'USD')
** :regular_shipping, the shipping cost (default $0)
* Or any Object that has a method called to_google_product that returns a hash
  like the one described.

Once you have a cart full of items, you can generate the XML for the API call
by calling Cart#checkout_xml, although you'll probably just want to add a
checkout button to your page with Cart#checkout_button.  This method generates
HTML for a form containing a button and the hidden inputs necessary to call
Google Checkout.  Cart#checkout_button has plenty of options for controlling
the look of the button.  Once again, the arguments are passed as a hash,
although the defaults are usually reasonable so you might not need to pass
anything.

* :size is the size of the button, one of :small, :medium, or :large.  Google
  is picky about the sizes of these buttons.  See GoogleCheckout::ButtonSizes
  for more information.  The default is :medium.
* :variant is one of 'disabled' or 'text'.  'disabled' means that the button 
  should be greyed-out; it is used in cases that the item you are selling
  cannot be bought via Google Checkout.  (There's a long list of items that
  are not allowed at https://checkout.google.com/seller/content_policies.html
* :buy_or_checkout must be one of :buy_now or :checkout .  This determines the
  look of the button that will be displayed.  The default is to use :checkout
  if there are two or more items in the cart.
* :style must be one of 'white' or 'trans'.  'white' gets you a white button,
  while 'trans' gets you a transparent button suitable for use on non-white
  backgrounds.  The default is 'white'.

  cart.checkout_button :size => :small, :style => 'trans'

When users click the button, they will be taken to the Google Checkout page
with a cart full of the products you specified, and your work is done.

== Missing Features

* Level 1 integration is complete except for tax tables
* Level 2 integration has been partly implemented and is in use at http://peepcode.com.  

See
http://checkout.google.com/support/sell/bin/answer.py?answer=42917&topic=8671
for more information about the two integration levels.

If there are missing features I haven't thought of, let me know.

== Bugs

No 'hard' bugs, I hope.  Pete's contact information is at the bottom of the page if you find one.  There may be more subjective bugs (e.g., design issues); feel free to tell me about these, too.
